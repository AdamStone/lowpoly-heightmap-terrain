Sketchy attempt at a lowpoly procedural terrain with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)

 - Heightmap generated by [Perlin noise](https://github.com/josephg/noisejs) with [fractional brownian motion](https://thebookofshaders.com/13/)
 - Chunks spawn ahead and unload behind for "infinite" terrain
 - Height-based color gradient
 - LOD transitions (didn't fix seam artifacts)
